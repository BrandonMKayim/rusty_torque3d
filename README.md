# rusty_torque3d
Uses the latest TGE 4.0.3 from development branch from cpp/h to Rust Language. Yay, a game engine!

This is a Work In Progress (WIP) project and hoping that this may lead to something.
Simply download Rust from their website and you can try to compile it yourself. Remember.. WIP.

The source code is provided in Rust (no cpp/h files) -- but currently writing this (12/20/2025), there will not be much yet, but this is maintained and active.
DISCORD for both a new video game, and a new engine: https://discord.gg/ZzKZV5PVJ5

Enjoy and Thank you For your Support!!!
